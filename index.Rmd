## Bio

Hi! 

I'm an undergraduate student of the Bachelor's Degree in Genomic Sciences at UNAM. 
I'm also research intern at FreyreLab, a laboratory mainly focused on bacterial 
gene regulation networks with a systems biology approach.

I'm interested in synthetic and computational biology and I'd like to do research 
in topics like morphogenesis, gene regulation networks and bio-remediation.
